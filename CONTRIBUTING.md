## Testing

All changes must be unit tested and meet the project test coverage threshold (73%) requirement.
Run `make test` to run all tests and generate coverage reports before submitting a pull request.

To write the `bats` tests for plugin,
1. Modify the tests
2. Run `docker-compose build plugin_test && docker-compose run --rm plugin_test`

## Formatting

All code must be formatted with `gofmt` (with the latest Go version) and pass `go vet`. The plugin must be linted with [buildkite-plugin-linter](https://github.com/buildkite-plugins/buildkite-plugin-linter). Run `make quality` to run all formatting checks.

## Releasing

- Ensure documentation is updated appropriately.
- Update [README.md]( https://github.com/monebag/monorepo-diff-buildkite-plugin/blob/master/README.md ) to the next version number.
- Update [ changelog ]( https://github.com/monebag/monorepo-diff-buildkite-plugin/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md ) using guidelines from [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).
- Merge changes to master.
- Create a new release. The version number must follow the format of `v<major>.<minor>.<patch>`. Eg. `v2.0.1`
- Github actions automatically builds and attachs the binary to the release.
