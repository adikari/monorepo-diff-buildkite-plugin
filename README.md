# Monorepo-diff-buildkite-plugin

This Monorepo plugin will assist you in triggering pipelines, as well as run commands in your CI by watching folders in your `monorepo`.

Check out this post to learn more about [**How to set up Continuous Integration for monorepo using Buildkite**](https://adikari.medium.com/set-up-continuous-integration-for-monorepo-using-buildkite-61539bb0ed76).


## Usefulness of the monorepo
A monorepo is a single, version-controlled code repository that houses multiple independent projects, offering benefits such as flexibility, streamlined management, and reduced tracking of changes and dependencies across multiple repositories. 

This approach allows teams to:
* Reduce overhead associated with duplicating code for microservices.
* Easily maintain and monitor the entire codebase.

Check out the [example monorepo source code](https://github.com/buildkite/monorepo-example).


## Using the plugin

If the version number is not provided then the most recent version of the plugin will be used. Do not use version number as `master` or any branch names.

#### `watch`

 It defines a list of paths or path to monitor for changes in the monorepo. It checks to see if there is a change to the subfolders specified in the path
 
#### `path`
A path or a list of paths to be watched, This part specifies which directory should be monitored.  It can also be a glob pattern. For example specify `path: "**/*.md"` to match all markdown files. A list of paths can be provided to trigger the desired pipeline or run command or even do a pipeline upload. 

#### `config`
This is a sub-section that provides configuration for running commands or triggering another pipeline when changes occur in the specified path
Configuration supports 2 different step types.

- [Trigger](https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines/trigger-step)

    The configuration for the `trigger` step https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines/trigger-step
  
    
    
    **Example**
    <br/>
    When changes are detected in these paths of the monorepo, it triggers the other pipelines "cms-deploy" and "email-deploy"

    ```yaml
    steps:
      - label: "Triggering pipelines with plugin"
        plugins:
          - monebag/monorepo-diff#v2.5.8:
             watch:           
              - path: app/cms/
                config: # Required [trigger step configuration]
                  trigger: cms-deploy # Required [trigger pipeline slug]
              - path:
                  - services/email
                  - assets/images/email
                config:
                  trigger: email-deploy
    ```
      
- [Command](https://buildkite.com/docs/pipelines/command-step)
  
    A `command` step runs one or more shell commands on one or more agents.


    **Example**
     <br/>
     
     When changes are detected in these paths, it triggers other steps or pipelines with relevant commands, labels, and agent configurations 
      
  ```yaml
      steps:
        - label: "Triggering pipelines"
          plugins:
            - monebag/monorepo-diff#v2.5.8:
                diff: "git diff --name-only HEAD~1"
                watch:
                  - path: app/cms/
                    config:
                      group: ":rocket: deployment"
                      command: "netlify --production deploy"
                      label: ":netlify: Deploy to production"
                      agents:
                        queue: "deploy"
                      env:
                        - FOO=bar
                  - path: app/service/
                    config:
                      command: "buildkite-agent pipeline upload ./frontend/.buildkite/pipeline.yaml"
  
  ```
      
  :warning: Warning: There is currently limited support for command configuration. Only the `command` property can be provided at this point in time. 



#### `diff` (optional)

This will run the script provided to determine the folder changes.
Depending on your use case, you may want to determine the point where the branch occurs
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1527234/finding-a-branch-point-with-git and perform a diff against the branch point.

##### Sample output:
```
README.md
lib/trigger.bash
tests/trigger.bats
```

Default: `git diff --name-only HEAD~1`

##### Examples:

`diff: ./diff-against-last-successful-build.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

set -ueo pipefail

LAST_SUCCESSFUL_BUILD_COMMIT="$(aws s3 cp "${S3_LAST_SUCCESSFUL_BUILD_COMMIT_PATH}" - | head -n 1)"
git diff --name-only "$LAST_SUCCESSFUL_BUILD_COMMIT"
```

`diff: ./diff-against-last-built-tag.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

set -ueo pipefail

LATEST_BUILT_TAG=$(git describe --tags --match foo-service-* --abbrev=0)
git diff --name-only "$LATEST_TAG"
```

**Example**

```yaml
steps:
  - label: "Triggering pipelines"
    plugins:
      - monebag/monorepo-diff#v2.5.8:
          diff: "git diff --name-only HEAD~1"
          watch:
            - path: "bar-service/"
              config:
                command: "echo deploy-bar"
            - path: "foo-service/"
              config:
                trigger: "deploy-foo-service"
```
#### `interpolation` (optional)

This controls the pipeline interpolation on upload, and defaults to `true`.
If set to `false` it adds `--no-interpolation` to the `buildkite pipeline upload`,
to avoid trying to interpolate the commit message, which can cause failures.

#### `env` (optional)

The object values provided in this configuration will be appended to `env` property of all steps or commands.

```yaml
steps:
  - label: "Triggering pipelines"
    plugins:
      - monebag/monorepo-diff#v2.5.9:
          diff: "git diff --name-only HEAD~1"
          watch:
            - path: "foo-service/"
              config:
                trigger: "deploy-foo-service"
                label: "Triggered deploy"
                build:
                  message: "Deploying foo service"
                  env:
                    - HELLO=123
                    - AWS_REGION
```

#### `log_level` (optional)

Add `log_level` property to set the log level. Supported log levels are `debug` and `info`. Defaults to `info`.

```yaml
steps:
  - label: "Triggering pipelines"
    plugins:
      - monebag/monorepo-diff#v2.5.8:
          diff: "git diff --name-only HEAD~1"
          log_level: "debug" # defaults to "info"
          watch:
            - path: "foo-service/"
              config:
                trigger: "deploy-foo-service"
 
```

#### `hooks` (optional)

Currently supports a list of `commands` you wish to execute after the `watched` pipelines have been triggered

```yaml
hooks:
  - command: upload unit tests reports
  - command: echo success
```

#### `wait` (optional)

Default: `true`

By setting `wait` to `true`, the build will wait until the triggered pipeline builds are successful before proceeding


**Example**

```yaml
steps:
  - label: "Triggering pipelines"
    plugins:
      - monebag/monorepo-diff#v2.5.8:
          diff: "git diff --name-only $(head -n 1 last_successful_build)"
          interpolation: false
          env:
            - env1=env-1 # this will be appended to all env configuration
          hooks:
            - command: "echo $(git rev-parse HEAD) > last_successful_build"
          watch:
            - path:
                - "ops/terraform/"
                - "ops/templates/terraform/"
              config:
                command: "buildkite-agent pipeline upload ops/.buildkite/pipeline.yml"
                label: "Upload pipeline"
                # following configs are available in command. notify is not available in trigger step
                notify:
                  - basecamp_campfire: https://basecamp-url
                  - github_commit_status:
                      context: my-custom-status
                  - slack: '@someuser'
                    if: build.state === "passed"
                # soft_fail: true
                soft_fail:
                  - exit_status: 1
                  - exit_status: "255"
                retry:
                  automatic:
                  - limit: 2
                    exit_status: -1
                agents:
                  queue: performance
                artifacts:
                  - "logs/*"
                env:
                  - FOO=bar

          wait: true
```
